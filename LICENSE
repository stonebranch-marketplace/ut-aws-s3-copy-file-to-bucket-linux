*Rights to use apps made available on the marketplace*

If you download an app from our marketplace we, in relation to our own apps, or the third party user that uploaded the app grant(s) to you the right to review, test, evaluate, use and operate your app in any possibly way, including the worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, sublicensable right to use, copy, change, amend or incorporate in or combine with any other material, make-available and otherwise distribute your app, online or offline, to any third party for any private or commercial use, including any use by affiliated companies. For the avoidance of doubt, this right shall not include the right to publish the app on any other marketplace, which right shall remain with us or the initial owner (as the case may be).

If we notify you that that one or more apps provided by us or any other user of our marketplace infringes or might infringe any third party rights, you must immediately stop using the app(s) designated in our notice and return or delete all copies of the relevant app(s) in your possession.

*Ownership in Intellectual Property*

Notwithstanding any licenses and rights to use granted hereunder, nothing in these terms is intended to or transfers or assigns any ownership and/or intellectual property rights in any app (including any content, data, documentation or other material included in the app or provided together with the app). Except as expressly granted under these terms, neither party shall have any right in the other party’s intellectual property intellectual property or proprietary rights.

Subject to the licenses and rights to use granted by you to us or any third party user under these terms, nothing herein is intended to prevent you from pursuing you rights against any third party, provided that you hereby acknowledge that any use by us or by any third party user as permitted hereunder shall not be considered an infringement of you rights and shall not be considered as support or contribution to any third party’s infringement.

If we receive a notice from you or a third party that one or more apps provided by you infringe or might infringe any third party rights, we will as soon as reasonably possible take down your app and return or delete all copies of the relevant app(s) in our possession and we shall have the right to post any corresponding information on our marketplace and/or inform any other users individually about any infringement or alleged infringement in order to avoid any damages.

You shall indemnify us, our officers, employees and agents, our affiliated companies and their officers, employees and agents and our users from any third party claims and any damages, losses or costs (including reasonable attorney fees), arising out of or in connection with any alleged or actual infringement of your app of any third party rights.

Upon termination of this agreement for cause by us you must immediately stop using all apps from our marketplace or the apps designated in our notice and return or delete all copies of the relevant app or apps in your possession.

*No warranty*

The marketplace publishes and provides all apps on an “as is” basis. Each user may review, test, evaluate, use and operate each app at its own responsibility and at its own risk.

We do not provide any warranty or guarantee that any apps made available on our marketplace are usable, merchantable, free from defects or fit for any general or special purpose. This applies even if we have reviewed, tested, evaluated or commented any such app.

We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the content, use, operation, licensing, safety, security or maintenance of any app made available on our marketplace by us or by a third party.

We expressly disclaim all warranties and guarantees, including in particular any warranties or guarantees that the apps are usable, merchantable, free from defects or fit for any general or special purpose.

*Liability*

We are liable without limitation for damages resulting from dead or bodily injury caused by our negligence or intent, as well as in the case of intent or gross negligence, fraudulent concealment of a defect or assumption of any guarantee for the quality of a product or service.

In the event of a breach of material contractual obligations, our liability in case of slight negligence is limited to the contract-typical, foreseeable damage. Material contractual obligations are those which arise from the nature of the contract and whose violation would jeopardize the achievement of the purpose of the contract as well as obligations imposed by the contract in order to achieve the purpose of the contract whose proper performance is conditional for the fulfilment of the contract and that the user may usually rely on.

Liability under the German Product Liability Act and other cases of mandatory liability under applicable laws shall remain unaffected (if and to the extent applicable).

Liability for loss of user data is excluded.

All of the foregoing shall apply accordingly to the personal liability of our officers, employees and agents and our affiliated companies and their officers, employees and agents.

*Confidentiality*

For the purposes of this clause, confidential information means any information which has been disclosed by or on behalf of a party or its affiliates in confidence and has been marked as “confidential” or which by its nature ought to be regarded as confidential (the “Confidential Information”), provided that any app (including any content, data, documentation or other material included in the app or provided together with the app) shall not be considered as Confidential Information.

Each party shall treat the other party’s Confidential Information confidential. In particular, the user shall, and shall ensure that its affiliates and employees shall, not disclose any Confidential Information received from us to any third party and shall not use the same other than for the purpose of this agreement.

The confidentiality obligations hereunder shall not apply to information that: (a) is required to be disclosed by applicable laws, provided that the disclosing party promptly notifies the other party of its requirement to disclose, and co-operates with the other party in avoiding or limiting the disclosure; (b) was already in the possession of the party making the disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality when it was received from the other party or its affiliates; (c) was already in the public domain at the time of disclosure, except as a result of a breach of the agreement; or (d) was independently developed without access to the other party’s or its affiliates’ Confidential Information.

Nothing herein shall restrict either party from disclosing Confidential Information of the other party or its affiliates if and to the extent required by law or for the purposes of legal proceedings; or if and to the extent required by any securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which that party is subject; or prevent either party from disclosing Confidential Information to its affiliates, consultants and other professional advisors, auditors and bankers.

*Force Majeure*

Our performance and liability hereunder is subject to any circumstances beyond our control or beyond the control of our suppliers, subcontractors or agents, including but not limited to strikes or labour disputes (whether at the individual company or industry wide), floods, fire, storm, war, riot, acts of God, rules, laws, orders, restrictions, embargoes, quotas, actions or in-actions of any government, foreign or domestic, or any agency or subdivision thereof, accidents, shortages of transportation facilities, withholding of products by customs, loss of products in warehouses, or other contingency beyond our reasonable control or the reasonable control of our suppliers, subcontractors or agents or otherwise unavoidable.

*Export Control*

You are responsible to comply with all export control regulations. You shall not export or re-export any app or parts thereof made available through our marketplace into any EU or US embargoed countries or to anyone on the EU or US lists of specially designated nationals or any EU or US denied persons or entities lists. You represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use or re-export any app or any parts thereof for any purposes prohibited by EU or US law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. You will be solely responsible for ensuring that your provision of apps or parts thereof to users through our marketplace complies with any export regulations.

*Miscellaneou*

Unless otherwise expressly set out herein, the user shall not assign, transfer, charge or otherwise deal with any of its rights hereunder, nor grant, declare, create or dispose of any right or interest in them, without our prior written consent.

Unless otherwise expressly set out herein, this agreement is made for the benefit of the parties and is not intended to benefit any third party or be enforceable by any third party.

This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter.

No amendment, variation or waiver of this agreement shall be valid unless in writing and duly executed by or on behalf of all of the parties to it.

Each of the provisions of this agreement is severable. If a provision is held to be or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, then (a) to the extent that it is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be deemed not to be included in this agreement, it shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of the other provisions of this agreement, or of that or any provisions of this agreement in any other jurisdiction; and (b) the parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to replace it with a valid and enforceable substitute provision or provisions, with an effect as close as possible to the intended effect of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision.

This agreement and the relationship between the parties shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of Germany. Any disputes shall be subject to German jurisdiction and the courts of Frankfurt/Germany.
